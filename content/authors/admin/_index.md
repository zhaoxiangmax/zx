Zhao is a research student working on optimal biodiveristy surveying and monitoring design problem in terrestrial Antarctica.

He worked on a project that was desigend to protect the giant panda’s habitats from free-ranging livestock threat in Southwest China, with financial support from Birdlife International Young Conservation Leaders Awards. He also initiated, managed, and coordinated a marine conservation program – Blue Pioneers Program 2018 – which was designed to empower China’s local marine NGOs and young leaders who work on the frontline of marine and coastal protection. This project has built a strong network connecting participants to environmental economists, marine scientists, senior leaders of international NGOs, and foundations from all over the world. In 2018, the King and Queen of Norway received 3 participants and Prof. Kathinka Fürst, the Academic Supervisor of this program, during their visit to China. Zhao introduced this program to the State Secretary of Norway in a close-door meeting on the same day.

The Panda Project and the Blue Pioneers Program were conducted during Zhao’s employment with Duke Kunshan University, Kunshan, China. Before that, Zhao got his bachelor’s degree in Environmental Engineering from Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China.
