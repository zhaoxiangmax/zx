I am a software developer, eResearcher, and conservation scientist with expertise in R programming, ecological modelling, and spatial analysis. I joined QCIF in 2024 as a Software Developer and R Specialist, contributing to the EcoCommons Platform. I completed my MPhil at QUT, where I applied spatial and statistical modelling to biodiversity research in Antarctica. I have also tutored GIS and environmental planning at QUT, and previously worked on a panda conservation project in China, earning the BirdLife International Young Conservation Leaders Award.
Zhao is a research student working on optimal biodiversity surveying and monitoring design problem in terrestrial Antarctica.
