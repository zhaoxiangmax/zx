abstract: Species distribution models (SDMs) are essential tools for understanding where species occur, the environmental factors influencing their distributions, and how habitats may change under climate and land-use pressures. This five-day, hands-on workshop introduces participants to both the theory and practical application of SDMs using the EcoCommons platform, Australia’s national digital infrastructure for ecological modelling. Through lectures, demonstrations, guided tutorials, and group exercises, participants will work through the complete modelling workflow — from data preparation to model building, validation, and interpretation. By the end of the workshop, attendees will have the knowledge and confidence to independently develop and apply SDMs in research and conservation practice.
